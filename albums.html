							<p>The OF Tape Vol. 2 is the debut studio album by American hip hop collective Odd Future. It was released on March 20, 2012 by Odd Future Records and RED Distribution. It serves as the sequel to their debut mixtape, The Odd Future Tape (2008). The album features appearances from Odd Future members Hodgy Beats, Tyler, the Creator, Domo Genesis, Frank Ocean, Mike G, The Internet, Taco, Jasper Dolphin, Left Brain and L-Boy, as well as an uncredited appearance from Earl Sweatshirt. Production on the album was primarily handled by Left Brain and Tyler, the Creator, with Frank Ocean, Hal Williams and Matt Martians also receiving production credits. Lyrically the album ranges from being serious to being satirical, with some tracks offering an overly absurdist take on rap.

							Odd Future toured in support of the album, and four singles were released from it, all of which received music videos. The album peaked at number 5 on the US Billboard 200 and received mostly positive reviews from critics, receiving a score of 71 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic. Critics generally praised the presence of Tyler and Ocean, the vintage style of production and album closer, "Oldie".</p>
